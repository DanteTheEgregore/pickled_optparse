No functional differences just some internal refactoring and clean up.

* Replaced intrusive replacement of make_switch with a wrapper and alias.
* Minor reorginization of directories to follow best practices.
* Added Jeweler style versioning.
* Cleaned up and moved example.rb to examples directory (best practices?).
* Cleaned up rakefile.
* Kludged the hell out of rdoc to make it allow example ruby files in the files section.
