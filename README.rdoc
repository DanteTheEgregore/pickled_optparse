= pickled_optparse

Allows a programmer to easily add required switches to a Ruby app using the built-in OptionParser class.

To make a switch required simple add the symbol :required anywhere in the list of options like so:
  
  opts.on("-f [foo]", String, :required, "Required option") do |o|
    @options[:foo] = o
  end

Then at the end of your OptionParser do block add this:
  
  if opts.missing_switches?
    puts opts.missing_switches
    puts opts
    exit
  end

You of course need to require the "pickled_optparse" gem but that's it. You don't need to require the opt_parse file because that's already handled for you.

For a complete example see the example.rb file.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
